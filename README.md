# knife OPC

# Description

This is an UNOFFICIAL and EXPERIMENTAL knife plugin to support basic
organization and user operations in Opscode Private Chef (OPC).

# Installation

This knife plugin is packaged as a gem.  To install it, clone the
git repository and run the following:

    gem build knife-opc.gemspec
    gem install knife-opc-0.0.1.gem

# Configuration

## knife.rb
Unlike other knife subcommands the subcommands in the knife-opc
plugin make API calls against the root of your OPC installations API
endpoint.

Typically the chef_server_url for your OPC installation may look like
this:

    chef_server_url https://chef.yourdomain.com/organizations/ORGNAME

To configure knife-opc, set the `chef_server_root` option to the root
of your OPC installation:

    chef_server_root https://chef.yourdomain.com/

Using this plugin requires giving your user additional permissions on
objects within your Private Chef installation.
